## Testing
 
### React tests
 
To run tests, run the following command: yarn test
 
Located in src/pages/home/__ tests __. 

#### Tests for home page.
 
1. expect Halloween to be found as category:
 
This tests that expect Halloween to be found as category using msw to mock api call.

## React architecture

The project re-uses Post.js which allows the user to for example remove post, like and bookmark on all pages where it is used.

The project re-uses Comment.js which show comments in a common way when used as a component.

## React libraries

The project uses a package called testing-library/jest-dom which allow us to test components.

The project uses a package called msw to mock api calls and return mocked data which is a nice feature when testing.

The project uses a package callde react-infinite-scroll-component which allow us to not load all items from datase in one call but rather in chunks.

The projects uses axios as a helper to fetch data from our api.

The project uses jwt-decode to decode our jwt token to get the expiration date from the authentication token.

The project uses bootstrap to get a neat way to handle boostrap in react with bootstrap components for example \<Row> instea of \<div className="row">.

## Issues

### Cookie 3rd party mobile
Due to project requirements with website in separate domains the cookie cannot be shared and therefore it is a problem in Safari and mobile which does not allow cross-site tracking. It is however possible to turn it of in mobile, here is how you do it:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92020968/198820423-ff5a080f-0b00-4e5f-ab5c-0fe6358f2e40.png)

If the task did not require multiple projects I would have used an approach where I had put the website in the same domain with a proxy.

### Admin web and website cookie
A known issue is that if a administrator log in to admin web and then visits website the cookie is not valid so the admin has to log out before using website.

## Validator testing
 
### Css validation:
When validating the css files separatly the result is fine.
Jigsaw warns about 3-party (bootstrap) library which I cannot affect.
Jigsaw warns about google font import which is as expected.

### Html validation:
Document checking completed. No errors or warnings to show.
 
## Accessibility
